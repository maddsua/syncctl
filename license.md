### 1. The "Don't Forget Me" Clause

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. It’s the very least you could do, considering I spent three weekends on this while you were out having a life.

I AM PROVIDING THIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:

* The warranty that it actually works.
* The warranty that it won't delete your your entire fucking system.
* The warranty that I care about your deadline.

### 3. The Liability Shifting

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY. IF YOU USE THIS IN A MISSION-CRITICAL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AND EVERYTHING GOES SIDEWAYS, THAT’S A "YOU" PROBLEM.

WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, MY TOTAL LIABILITY IS EXACTLY **$0.00**.
